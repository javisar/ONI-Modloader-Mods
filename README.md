* Please don't report bugs you encounter to Klei while mods are active. People at Klei work hard and shouldn't be bothered with bug reports which might originate from mods.
* BE AWARE that many of the mods are still a WIP and may fail. If you are having problems use a clean ONI installation and try to test the mods one by one to narrow the error. Then post a issue in github.
* We do not take any responsibility for broken saves or any other damage. Use this software at your own risk.
* If you load a savegame, it requires that you have exactly the same mods when you saved it.
